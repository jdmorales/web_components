Web Components
======================

This is a example of web components using the four Specs.

**Custom Elements:** allows authors to define their own custom tags (spec).

**HTML Imports:** a way to include and reuse HTML documents via other HTML documents (spec).

**Shadow DOM:** provides encapsulation by hiding DOM subtrees under shadow roots (spec).

**Template**: Model Rendering of templates which this are activated when component is rendered.


**Note: 
For Run example you must run on server, because HTML imports follow the same restrictions as XHR.
Need to be fetched from http(s). Blink imposes security restrictions on what you can do with file://.**
